# 🏃‍♂️ JaMRun – jog a Marathon Run 

This repository contains the source code for my thesis project, which explores machine learning approaches to predict suggestions for recreational marathon runners to nail their desired marathon finishing time. The final model selected was an **Extra Trees Regressor 🌲**, chosen after extensive comparison against:

- **Linear Regression 📈**
- **LassoCV 🧮**
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) 🤖**

Performance was evaluated using cross-validation across multiple random seeds to ensure robustness and generalization.
